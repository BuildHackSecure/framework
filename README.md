# Framework
#### Lightweight MVC PHP framework

This is simple MVC PHP framework I use to start most of my PHP projects.

It Includes the following features:

- MVC Layout with model, controller and view separation
- Model & Controller Autoloading
- Routing with pattern matching and HTTP method separation
- PDO wrapper for handing read & write connections for MySQL replication which aides in scaling
- Example template is ready to go with bootstrap and jQuery
